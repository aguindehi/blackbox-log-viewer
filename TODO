TODO for Web App Mode
=====================

[ ] menu button not working if width<620px
[ ] settings are too wide and do not resize in a responsive way (this probably needs a media query and more css)
[ ] changelog is too wide and width is hardcoded (instad of 80% of page width or similar)

DONE:
=====

[x] missing touchmove to js/grapher
[x] missing touchmove to js/graph_spectrum
[x] missing touchmove to js/seekbar
[x] add appcache support
